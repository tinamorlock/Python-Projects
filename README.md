# Python-Projects
This repository will host all my projects created with the Python programming language during the Tech Academy's bootcamp.
## Introduction
There are some practice .py files here and some structured programs. The larger programs will be included in their own directories.
## Finished Projects
### Nice or Mean Game
This is a simple, text-based adventure game that determines if someone is mostly nice or mean.
### Database Assignment
This script takes a list of filenames and searches through them to find .txt files specifically. The database gets filled with those filenames, then it returns to the console a formatted list of those filenames from the databases. Uses SQLite.
