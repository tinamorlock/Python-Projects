# Python-Projects
This repository will host all my projects created with the Python programming language during the Tech Academy's bootcamp.
## Introduction
There are some practice .py files here and some structured programs. The larger programs will be included in their own directories.
## Finished Projects
### Nice or Mean Game
This is a simple, text-based adventure game that determines if someone is mostly nice or mean.
### Database Assignment
This script takes a list of filenames and searches through them to find .txt files specifically. The database gets filled with those filenames, then it returns to the console a formatted list of those filenames from the databases. Uses SQLite.
### Inheritance Assignment
Creates a parent class (MEAL) and defines children classes (BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER) that could be used for a meal planner or calorie tracker application.
### Student Tracking
This program runs in a GUI designed with tkinter. It allows the user to update, add, and delete entries to a student database, using SQLite3.
### File Transfer
This program runs in a GUI designed with tkinter. It allows the user to select a source directory and a destination directory. Then it checks the source directory to see if the files there have been modified in the past 24 hours. If so, it transfers them to the destination directory.
