# Python-Projects
This repository will host all my projects created with the Python programming language during the Tech Academy's bootcamp.
## Introduction
There are some practice .py files here and some structured programs. The larger programs will be included in their own directories.
## Finished Projects
### Student Tracking
This program runs in a GUI designed with tkinter. It allows the user to update, add, and delete entries to a student database, using SQLite3.
### File Transfer
This program runs in a GUI designed with tkinter. It allows the user to select a source directory and a destination directory. Then it checks the source directory to see if the files there have been modified in the past 24 hours. If so, it transfers them to the destination directory.
### Web Page Generator
This program runs in a GUI designed with tkinter. It allows the user to click to either display a default HTML file, or they can create a basic web page with custom text.
### Django University
Basic Django admin site with two databases: one for classes and one for campuses. Uses SQLite3.
### BlueBird Banking
This is a back-end web app for a bank that allows a bank employee to add accounts and transactions to keep a running total of a customer's Balance Sheet.
